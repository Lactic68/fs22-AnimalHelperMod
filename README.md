# fs19-HappyAnimalsMod
This mod allows you to easily fill up all levels for your animal husbandries. I created this mod, because I found it a lot of effort to initialy fill up the husbandries after purchasing the animals. Keeping them filled up thereafter is part of my game :-) Thats why its bound to keyInput instead of continuously filling op the husbandries.

## Usage:
While playing, press Ctrl + Alt + 9 for a complete refill.
Mod fills foodTypes, water and straw for all AnimalTypes that come with FS19 (Cows, Pigs, Chicken, Horses, Sheep)

## History:
Please refer to modDesc.xml for a complete changelog. The following releases are available:
* xx-2018 v1.0 - Initial version
* 11-2020 v1.1 - Scripts reworked to dynamically determine fillTypes to top up.
* 11-2020 v1.1.1 - Training of horses has been added.

## Untested:
I still have to test the mod. I cannot guarantee it will work errorfree. I played a bit with it for now, with only two husbandries (Cows and horses) and it seems to work. But, as mentioned before, no guarantee can or wil be given this mod works correct. I hope to be able to test it some more soon.

## Multiplayer:
For now, I have set Multiplayer support to false... I am not interested in multiplayer support, so this is untested.
Pull-Requests with changes allowing MultiPlayer support are welcome.

## Contibute?
