# fs19-HappyAnimalsMod
This mod allows you to easily fill up all levels for your animal husbandries. I created this mod, because I found it a lot of effort to initialy fill up
the husbandries after purchasing the animals.

## Usage:
While playing, press Ctrl + Alt + 7 for a complete refill.
Mod fills foodTypes, water and straw for all AnimalTypes that come with FS19 (Cows, Pigs, Chicken, Horses, Sheep)

## Untested:
I still have the test the mod. I cannot guarantee it will work errorfree. I finished the code on a workstation that does not have the game installed.
Hope to be able to test it soon.

## Multiplayer:
For now, I have set Multiplayer support to false... I am not interested in multiplayer support, so this is untested.
Pull-Requests with changes allowing MultiPlayer support are welcome.

## Contibute?
